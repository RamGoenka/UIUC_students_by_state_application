## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to find the number of students, whether it be undergraduate, graduate, professional (or the combined sum of those) from a given state (in the United States of America) and a given year range (from 1975 to 2017). To use this app, one must first use the drop down option labled "State" to select a state they wish to view the number of students from. Then the user must use the slider bar to adjust the year range according to their preference (the lowest you can set it to is 1975 and the highest is 2017), and then finally the user must use the drop down under the section named "Level" to select the level of study of the students they wish to find the number of during the given year range and state. The possible levels are undergraduate, graduate, professional or a total of the three. Once the user has selected the paramters, the graph on the application will plot a line graph of the year by year by year student count for the given state and year range. The years are on the x-axis as they are the independent variable and the number of students are on the y-axis as they are the dependent variable. This application can be used to notice trends, patterns and motivate further research on the number of students from each state during given time frames. This allows us to see if certain states have more students than the others during particular time frames and which states seem to have the general most students. Obviously since UIUC is the flagship state school of Illinois, the number of students from Illinois during any time frame will most likely be the most compared to any state, however we can use this application to see which other states had the most students and then compare their geographic region and distance to that of Illinois as well as income levels since UIUC for out of state students costs a decent amount of money and each state has a different level of average household income and minimum wage which can play a factor into which state has more students going to UIUC. The table tab of the application allows the user to perform the same actions as the plot tab but the data outputted is in a tabular form rather than graphical. 

## Data

The dataset used for this project is from one of Professor Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider who is a faculty member in the University of Illinois Department of Computer Science. The data consists of 5 rows, namely: State, Year, Undergrad, Grad, Professional, Total. The State row contains names of states alphabetically, starting from Alabama and ending at Wyoming. The Year row includes year values that range from 1975 to 2017. The undergraduate row contains the number of undergraduates in a given year and from a given state. Similarly, the Grad and Professional rows contain the number of Graduate students and Professional Students in a given year and from a given state at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. The total row contains the sums of the Undergrad, Grad, and Professional column for a given state and year. A link to the GitHub repository where the data was optained from as well as the link to the dataset is provided in the references section.
